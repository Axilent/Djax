Django / ACE Integration

Djax integrates the Django web framework with `Axilent ACE(http://www.axilent.com/products/ace/)`_. ACE is a sophisticated content targeting system that can be used for product recommendations, related content, personalization and contextual advertising.

Djax links Django models with ACE content types, enabling the use of ACE as a CMS for a Django website.  It also provides easy integration with ACE's targeting Content Channels, and provides integration with ACE's user profiling system.
